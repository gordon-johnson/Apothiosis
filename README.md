# Apothiosis (https://www.indiedb.com/games/the-apotheosis)
# Apotheosis is a fast paced, bullet hell boss battle game. Players must work cooperatively to heal, power up, and protect one another as they defeat epic bosses.
# This game is the cumulation of 3 months of effort between myself and 3 of my peers.
# We worked together to design and create a game from scratch, putting out several deliverables throughout the semester,
# as well as documenting our progress on indiedb, using Jira to collaborate, and playtesting other teams games.
# All of this effort led our team to placing 3rd at the end of the year Game Showcase.  We hope you enjoy Apothiosis.
